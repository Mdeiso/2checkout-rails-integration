### _For a discount on 2Checkoutâ€™s monthly fees, enter promo code:  GIT2CO  during signup._

###Introduction
In this repo we show an example integration of the 2Checkout payment method into an existing Rails 3.2.2 shopping cart application using the [twocheckout](https://rubygems.org/gems/twocheckout) gem.

This repository contains both an example before and after application so that you can easily see the integration changes. If you would like to read a tutorial that explains the integration, 
please visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/craigchristenson/2checkout-rails-integration/wiki).

If you have any questions or concerns, let me know. 
I will be happy to help with your application and get you up and running.
